## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Gather real estate data using web scraping or public APIs.
- Save the raw data in a structured format like CSV or directly into a database.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
- Engineer features like "price per square foot" or "proximity to amenities."

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize trends in pricing, location, and property characteristics.
- Generate interactive charts and maps to uncover insights.

### 4. **Machine Learning**
- Train models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict house prices.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics like RMSE or MAE.
- Fine-tune models for better predictions.

### 5. **Pipeline Automation**
- Use tools like Airflow to automate the data collection and cleaning processes.
- Schedule updates to keep the data and predictions current.

### 6. **Dashboard**
- Build a user-friendly dashboard with Streamlit or Dash:
  - Visualize market trends.
  - Provide interactive predictions based on user inputs.

### 7. **Deployment**
- Deploy the system on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP).
- Containerize the application using Docker for portability.
- Set up CI/CD for continuous improvements.
